Weather App:

The weather application allows users to view the weather details of a city by giving city name as input. 

The application gives a visual appeal to the users by making use of appropriate backgrounds for weather conditions such as rain,
thunderstorm, snow and fog. Simultaneously, the application also displays a small icon as a sign of the current weather. 
By this, users become aware of the weather conditions without having to see the temperature or weather description in the application.
